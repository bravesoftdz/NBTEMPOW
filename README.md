# NBTEMPOW V. 2.1
NBTempoW is a forensic tool for making timelines from block devices image files (raw, ewf,etc.). It uses TSK (The Sleuthkit https://www.sleuthkit.org/) and it has been developed with Lazarus V. 1.6.2 (Delphi compatible cross-platform IDE for Rapid Application Development). It runs only in Windows.
If the device image file is splitted, you can select just the first chunk.
